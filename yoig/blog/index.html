          		  I hate sickness. Sickness cripples, divides, and makes you powerless. Sickness crippled Grandfather, he can't move; it divided us, I can't see him at will; and most of all, it makes you powerless, the feeling that there is nothing you can't do. Speaking of being powerless, I thought earlier: "Captain Narita and his men had such power over our lives" (Choi 32). Seriously, look at what they did to Grandfather! Anyways, I haven't heard from Grandfather for a few hours. I hope he's doing okay. While I am waiting in the yard, I wonder: Is it even worth living as a Korean?
          		  I mean, look at these Japanese, they are oppressing us to the limit where we don't have a point. Grandfather always had hope of the war being over, effectively ending Japanese occupation; but I feel that hope is very improbable. I feel bad thinking of these terrible thoughts, but the Japanese are really pushing it! Well, right now, I am being called up to Grandfather's room. Finally! Maybe I'll get some answers....

					Oh America! As I thought before: "Did the Americans know how long we had been waiting for them?...Grandfather and Mother were counting on them" (Choi 99)? Humbug. I want to believe that the Russians are here to help us, but look at what they do, they steal and give us smug smiles. Oh America! Please come here and help us! As Grandfather once said: "Korea was a little shrimp caught in a struggle between giants" (Choi 97). If Koreans' fate is sealed similar to what Grandfather said: Is it worth even worth living as a Korean?

					Well, at least America is here...kind of. It seems that Korea has split into two at the 38 parallel. Well, I have some packing to do. In the meantime, we are to celebrate <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism"><i>Marxism (a form of Communism)</i></a> and wave our red flags with weird yellow anchors. Oh! I almost forgot to tell you that Father and my three brothers are okay! Mother broke into tears of joy when she heard this. As Kisa said: "I saw Uncle" (Choi 116)! Now since the Americans are in the South of Korea, I guess that it is worth to live as a Korean....

				   Mother no! Don't leave me with a whiny Inchun! Just kidding, but don't leave us! It just makes us drag our dispair right behind us!  Well, I guess I have to leave. On the bus, I realized how hard it is to be a <i>nuna</i>. For example, Inchun keeps on begging for food, so you have to forefit yours, sometimes he gets tired so you have stop and let him rest for a bit, but most of all: I have to act as Mother. This by far is the hardest job anyone could ever take. With Mother gone, Inchun looks up to me to protect him and most of all, get us to Seoul. Well, I guess it's nap time. Oh wait, I guess I can't sleep while Inchun keeps crying: "Mommy, Mommy, Mommy" (Choi 133).

				   "Dobraski, Dobraski" (Choi 146). Inchun says. Inchun seems pretty hopeful that this so-called Dobraski will help us find Mother, but I'm pretty sure that he is just a pink head trying to lure us into a trap. Why is Inchun so hopeful? Maybe Inchun is falling prey to their trap: give them some hope after all is lost, then snag them and put them in jail. Well, after three days of searching for Mother in this village, I guess we have to leave, and continue on our journey to Seoul. After this experience, I noticed that Dobraski helped us (by not putting us in jail), and giving Inchun a dark piece of bread. So maybe I was wrong. Inchun wasn't falling prey to a non-existent trap, he was just wiser than me, a knew that these people aren't here to put us in jail, but here to help us on our long journey to Seoul. Inchun, for teaching me this lesson, I will let you whine all you want, without me telling you to stop. Maybe not, but tomorrow, we will be free.

				   Oh the dilemma! To go back to Pyongyang, or to continue to Seoul. Maybe if we go back, we can get Aunt Tiger and Kisa to help us on our journey to Seoul, but what if they get killed? Or we get killed? Or they get detained at the train station just like Mother? Oh the dilemma! But the cornfield in front us looks very inviting, and maybe Mother is already in Seoul. You know what, enough of this wishy-washy trait of thought! I shall storm down that cornfield full of pride, with Inchun trailing right behind me! And when we reach the barbed wire fence, Inchun and I will lift the fence up and we will cross the fence, free in the South! I am confindent that Inchun and I can do this. For Mother, Aunt Tiger, Kisa, Grandfather, Father, Inchun, Hanchun, Jaechun, Hyunchun, and most of all, myself, I will cross the border safely, to preserve our family history and finally be free, once again. <i>A relatable quote: "I was so confused and scared that I was ready to say, 'Maybe we should go back to Pyongyang and see if my aunt can help us.'"</i>

				   The fence is near, and the start of opportunity could be near, or the end could be near. Mother would be proud of us: crossing the border, and getting to freedom all by ourselves...or dying all by ourselves. Right now, the future for us looks pretty dim, but--Inchun! Stop whining and chanting "Mommy, Mommy" (Choi 162). We have a mission, and we will complete it! <i>A relatable quote: "How inviting that barbed wire fence seemed" (Choi 162)!</i>

				   There is not a single day ever since I got to Seoul, that I don't wonder about Mother's whereabouts. Every. Single. Day. There is not a single day ever since Inchun got to Seoul, that he does not cry himself to sleep over the torture of losing his mother. Every. Single. Day. There is not a single day ever since Inchun and I got to Seoul, that Father wonders about Mother, and whether she is alive or not, alive or dead. Every. Single. Day. <br> <span style="text-align: center;">...</span> <br>In North Korea, for what I remember, we were oppressed and pretty much tortured to death (in Grandfather's case). But here we are free, free to do what ever we want.... So now, I guess it is worth it to live as a Korean.
