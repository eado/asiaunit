				  <h1>Sookan</h1>
				  <p>
					  <b>Strength:</b> One of Sookan's greatest strengths is her ability to act as a mother at will. When Inchun and Sookan were seperated from their mother, Inchun was longing for his mother. Sookan quickly turned herself into a mother figure, which helped in a huge way during their journey to the South. <br>
					  <b>Weakness:</b> Sookan's weakness is her inability to make decisions. For example, while they were in this village in North Korea, Sookan spent three days contemplating whether to go back to Pyongyang, or to continue to Seoul.<br>
					  <b>Defining Moment:</b> Sookan's defining moment is when she crossed the barbed-wire fence, passing into South Korea.<br>					 
					 <b>Essential Question:</b> To be, or not to be? (I know, so clich√©, but it fits.)<br>
					  <b>Picture:</b> The cresent moon represents Sookan looking over Inchun, but periodically.<br>

				  <h1>Grandfather</h1>
				  <p>
					  <b>Strength:</b> One of Grandfather's strengths is his ability to have hope for the future, while the current circumstances are dim, and when the people around him have no hope. Sadly, he never got to see the end of the Japanese occupation.<br>
					  <b>Weakness:</b> His inability to provide information about what her is thinking. In other words, he becomes to mysterious at times.<br>
					  <b>Defining Moment:</b> Grandfather's defining moment is when his beloved pine tree got chopped down. After this, his life proceeded in a downward spiral.<br>
					  <b>Essential Question:</b> How can the Japanese occupation help us?<br>

				  <h1>Mother</h1>
				  <p>
					  <b>Strength:</b> One of Mother's greatest strengths is her ability to differentiate between <u>black and white</u>; meaning she is able to tell when an event/decision is a positive one, or a negative one.<br>
					  <b>Weakness:</b> Her strength could also be a weakness: if she sees only black and white, there is no room for gray, possibly leading her to false assuptions and bias.<br>
					 <b>Defining Moment:</b> At the train station where she became detained. (Or, if you count the epilogue, the moment she had the courage to leave the house where she was a house maid.)<br>
					  <b>Essential Question:</b> Is there good in bad? Is there bad in good?<br>

				  <h1>Aunt Tiger</h1>
				  <p>
					  <b>Strength:</b> <br>
					  <b>Weakness:</b><br>
					  <b>Defining Moment:</b> Aunt Tiger's defining moment is when she declined to come with Mother to Seoul.<br>
					  <b>Essential Question:</b> If my husband came back, would he like how I act?<br>
					  <b>*Notice:</b> I am not trying to suggest that Aunt Tiger is a donkey, but instead that she is <i>headfirst</i> and <i>stubborn</i>, like this animal who <u>happens</u> to be a donkey.
