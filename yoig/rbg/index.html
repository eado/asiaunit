				<p style="text-align: center;">Sookan's Path of Becoming a Better Caring Companion</p>
				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sookan changes in the aspect of her caring throughout the book <i>Year of Impossible Goodbyes</i> when faced with the following situations: Inchun’s school advice, Mother’s detainment, and the need to leave North Korea. When Sookan was about to depart from her house to start Japanese school for the first time, Inchun gave her wise advice: “‘Nuna, remember not to speak one word of Korean and don't ask any questions. Just be quiet like me’” (Choi 65). After hearing this, Sookan knew that she could trust Inchun; the advice probably would have worked if she used it, making it so that she trusts Inchun more. This trust factor helps with her ‘caring ability’, due to Sookan only seeing the need to care if there is a benefit to it, but for this case, it is: wise advice. Later in the book, a difficult situation arose, which required Sookan to, in a sense, upgrade her caring abilities. At the train station in North Korea, Sookan's mother became detained. With this detainment, it was necessary for Sookan to act as a 'mother' as a consequence. "I saw them pull Mother out of line...She shot a glance at me...was trying to tell me to go on" (Choi 133). With Mother's departure, Sookan now has to be the 'acting-mother' for Inchun, as he is only able to move on with the help of a mother. Being an 'acting-mother' teaches Sookan how to be a better caring companion making it so that her caring abilities are surely 'upgraded'. Sookan makes her final change in her caring abilities when she departed from the 'comfort' of the village.  "He then disappeared as he saw some people approaching the station...with fear as I saw our only friend slip into the darkness" (Choi 156). The only reason Sookan stayed in the village is the hope that her Mother might be in the village, but when she arrived to her senses, she discovered that she is on her own, making it necessary for her to upgrade her caring abilities for the better. Wise advice, a harsh detainment, and a migration show Sookan’s path of becoming a better caring companion.
