          		  I hate sickness. Sickness cripples, divides, and makes you powerless. Sickness crippled Grandfather, he can't move; it divided us, I can't see him at will; and most of all, it makes you powerless, the feeling that there is nothing you can't do. Speaking of being powerless, I thought earlier: "Captain Narita and his men had such power over our lives" (Choi 32). Seriously, look at what they did to Grandfather! Anyways, I haven't heard from Grandfather for a few hours. I hope he's doing okay. While I am waiting in the yard, I wonder: Is it even worth living as a Korean?
          		  I mean, look at these Japanese, they are oppressing us to the limit where we don't have a point. Grandfather always had hope of the war being over, effectively ending Japanese occupation; but I feel that hope is very improbable. I feel bad thinking of these terrible thoughts, but the Japanese are really pushing it! Well, right now, I am being called up to Grandfather's room. Finally! Maybe I'll get some answers....

					Oh America! As I thought before: "Did the Americans know how long we had been waiting for them?...Grandfather and Mother were counting on them" (Choi 99)? Humbug. I want to believe that the Russians are here to help us, but look at what they do, they steal and give us smug smiles. Oh America! Please come here and help us! As Grandfather once said: "Korea was a little shrimp caught in a struggle between giants" (Choi 97). If Koreans' fate is sealed similar to what Grandfather said: Is it worth even worth living as a Korean?

					Well, at least America is here...sort of. It seems that Korea has split into two at the 38 parallel. Well, I have some packing to do. In the meantime, we are to celebrate <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism"><i>Marxism (a form of Communism)</i></a> and wave our red flags with weird yellow anchors. Oh! I almost forgot to tell you that Father and my three brothers are okay! Mother broke into tears of joy when she heard this. As Kisa said: "I saw Uncle" (Choi 116)! Now since the Americans are in the South of Korea, I guess that it is worth to live as a Korean....
