          <p>On a Plantation in Northern Philippines in 1825, there was this young lad who went by the name of Kidlat. Kidlat and his ina (mother) were very wealthy due to the money the plantation had given them. They had many fruits on their plantation: coconuts, pineapple, papaya, mango, rambutan and countless others. They also had lots of workers who planted, harvested, and traveled to the city to sell the fruit.<br><br>

Their fortunes, though, came to an end. A hurricane came and wiped out the entire plantation. When the workers came the next day to continue work, they were devastated by the damage and came up to the remains of our house and told Kidlat’s ina, “I am very sorry for your loss, but I don’t think I can work here anymore,” the worker said, “do you have my paycheck for the previous week though?” Kidlat’s ina gave him a crisp green check that read: “TWO HUNDRED”. The worker with his check walked onto his truck and drove into the distance. “Ina,” Kidlat asked, “how are we going to live in this rubble?”<br>
“I don't know, Kidlat. We might have to sell the very wood planks of our house to gain enough money,” said Kidlat’s ina in a solemn tone. Suddenly, Kidlat noticed that one of their goats was alive, “Ina!” Kidlat exclaimed. “A goat!”<br>
“Kidlat, take the goat to the market and sell it,” Kidlat’s ina said, “If we do this, we might not need to sell our wood planks.”<br>
So Kidlat pulled the goat by his collar and said “Sorry goat, but we need money.” When Kidlat arrived at the market, this old man approached him and said, “Hey kid, I have this sacred banana, and if you plant it, all your misfortunes will disappear. All I need is your goat.” Since Kidlat is a very gullible child, he took the offer and went home. <br>
<br>
“Kidlat! Why!” Kidlat’s mother sobbed. “That goat was all we had, and you busted it on this stupid banana!” Kidlat felt very bad, but had hope that the banana just might work. He went outside, dug a little hole, and put the banana in it. Then Kidlat retired to his “bedroom” (a spot on their beloved wooden planks) and slept.<br>
When Kidlat woke the next day, he saw a giant banana tree at the spot where he placed the banana. “Ina! Ina! Wake up! Look at the huge tree!” When Kidlat’s Ina saw the tree, she exclaimed “Oh my god! How did you get this?”<br>
Kidlat replied, “The banana.”<br>
“So, what did the person who gave you the banana say?” Kidlat’s Ina asked.<br>
“He said that all our misfortunes would go away.”<br>
“So maybe you should climb up the tree.”<br>
“Maybe, but Ina, I will do it.”<br>
Kidlat went up to the base of the tree and started climbing. When he got to the top, he saw higantes (giant(s))－yes, higantes. At first he was scared to death, but then spotted golden dung coming out of a dog. At the sight of this, he jumped off of the tree, dashed straight into the giant dog, grabbed onto its leash (he would have carried it, but it was just as big as him) and dashed back onto the tree. (You might be wondering how the dog was able to climb down the tree, but magically, the dog knew how to.) When the got to the bottom, he noticed the the higantes were starting to climb down the tree. Kidlat had to act fast if he wanted to keep his new pet. Then, all of a sudden, Kidlat’s ina came and gave him an ax. Of course! Kidlat thought. He started to cut the tree until it fell down. “So, what do you have there?” asked Kidlat’s ina.<br> 
“Oh, it’s a dog...that poops gold,” replied Kidlat. With all this gold poop, Kidlat and Ina became rich plantation owners once again...except for the fact that they sell gold, not fruit.<br>
