				  <h1>Yoko</h1>
				  <p>
					  <b>Strength:</b> One of Yoko's strength's her ability to persist, no matter the situation. <br>
					  <b>Weakness:</b> Her weakness is her inability to see the benefit of a certain action (she is stubborn, and doesn't want to do something beneficial). For example, when she had to shave her hair, she didn't want to, even though if she didn't she probably would have been dead. <br>
					  <b>Defining Moment:</b> When she shows her report card with straight As.<br>					 
					 <b>Essential Question:</b> Why us? Why do we have to endure this garbage way of life?<br>
					  <b>Picture:</b> The resistant Garfield represents Yoko's stubborness.<br>

				  <h1>Ko</h1>
				  <p>
					  <b>Strength:</b> Ko's strength is her ability to provide for her family, and be incredibly resourceful during the journey to Seoul.<br>
					  <b>Weakness:</b> Her inability to empathize with her sister. (She isn't nice to her sister.) For example, Ko said that they would be better off with Yoko dead.<br>
					  <b>Defining Moment:</b> When Mother died. After that she had to rid of her weakness, as she had to become the mother figure for Yoko.<br>
					  <b>Essential Question:</b> Why us? Why do we have to endure this garbage way of life?<br>
					  <b>Picture:</b> The beaver is very resourceful with the way it builds its wood dams, representing Ko since she is also resourceful.<br>

				  <h1>Mother</h1>
				  <p>
					  <b>Strength:</b> One of Mother's strengths is her determination. While she is old, she was still able to keep up with Ko in the journey to Seoul.<br>
					  <b>Weakness:</b> Mother's weakness is that she is too secretive. If Yoko and Ko knew about the whole 'money in bathroom' thing, it could have saved them a lot of worry.<br>
					 <b>Defining Moment:</b> N/A, she died.<br>
					  <b>Essential Question:</b> What will my children do without me?<br>

				  <h1>Hideyo</h1>
				  <p>
					  <b>Strength:</b> Hideyo's strength is his ability to stay loyal to his friends. During the journey to Seoul, he stayed with and supported his friends as long as he could.<br>
					  <b>Weakness:</b> Hideyo's weakness is his inability to see where is actions might take him. (He went to work at the factory, contrary to Mother's wants, and that got Hideyo in a very difficult situation.)<br>
					  <b>Defining Moment:</b> Hideyo's defining moment is when he crossed the border by 'diving deeper'.<br>
					  <b>Essential Question:</b> Will Mother and my sisters want to see me?<br>

				  <h1>Mr. Naido</h1>
				  <p>
					  <b>Strength:</b> Mr. Naido's strength is his ability to make others feel better. For example, Yoko feels much better after meeting with Mr. Naido after school everyday.<br>
					  <b>Weakness:</b> Though, Mr. Naido's weakness is his inability to speak fluently. (He always stutters.) This will make him suseptible to ridicule, which might make him insecure.<br>
					  <b>Defining Moment:</b> Mr. Naido's defining moment is when stood up to the other girls for Yoko.<br>
					  <b>Essential Question:</b> I am worth the same as everyone else?<br>
